I had nine lives but I lost all of them
And I’ve been searching in the night
And I’ve been searching in the rain
I tried to find them
But they disappeared
They walked away they dressed in black
They left my side and all I say
Is that I wasted time
When I looked for them
For now I know that things gone past
Are never to be found again
No never never again
I had nine lives
But lost all of them
